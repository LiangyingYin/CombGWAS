Infer_Summary_Statistics_for_Comorbidity_and_Single_disorder include two functions that could be utilized to infer to summary statistics of 
comorbid disorders or only single disorder based on the summary statistics of corresponding traits. To use these two
functions, we need to have the following information about the involved traits.
# harmon_data: harmonized summary statistics for two traits derived from TwosampleMR
# Size_TraitA: Sample size of trait A
# Size_TraitB: Sample size of trait B
# TraitA_preval: Disease prevalence of trait A
# TraitB_preval: Disease prevalence of trait B
# Comorbid_preval: Disease prevalence of comorbid trait
# LDSR_intercept : LD score regression intercept
