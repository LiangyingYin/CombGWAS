Getting started

Infer_Summary_Statistics_for_Comorbidity_and_Single_disorder include two functions that could be utilized to infer to summary statistics of 
comorbid disorders or only single disorder based on the summary statistics of corresponding traits. To use these two
functions, we need to have the following information about the involved traits.
# Description of input parameters
# harmon_data: harmonized summary statistics for two traits derived from TwosampleMR
# Size_TraitA: Sample size of trait A
# Size_TraitB: Sample size of trait B
# TraitA_preval: Disease prevalence of trait A
# TraitB_preval: Disease prevalence of trait B
# Comorbid_preval: Disease prevalence of comorbid trait
# LDSR_intercept : LD score regression intercept  


1. System requirement
   1) Operating system: Linux, MacOS, Windows.
   2) Dependencies(R packages):locfdr,sfsmisc,msm,rootSolve,numDeriv,mvtnorm and mvtnorm.
   3) R versions: no specific requirement as long as the dependent R packages are accessible.
   4) Other requirements: None.
   Notes: These two functions have been tested on different R versions and operating systems, i.e., R version 3.4.4(x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)) and
   R version 3.6.3(x86_64-apple-darwin15.6).
   
2. User guidance
   You can directly download the two function to your local depository for usage. In order to use the two functions,you will need to install the 
   dependent R packages first, i.e.,locfdr,sfsmisc,msm,rootSolve,numDeri and mvtnorm. harmonized summary statistics for two traits can be derived from
   the ‘harmonise_data’ function in the R package TwoSampleMR(https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR). Sample sizes of corresponding traits can be 
   directly extracted from the corresponding research where the summary statistics of studied traits are derived. LDSR_intercept could be calculated
   by LD score regression (LDSR)(https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) based on the summary statistics of two studied traits.
   
3. Demo
   We provide a toy example and demo code for the use of the two functions under the directory of Example. For more details, please refer to Example/Demo.R
